# HolyLabRegistry
This is a HolyLab private registry to use lab packages according to julia 0.7 Pkg3 design.

# Usage
Clone this repository under DEPOT_PATH/registries. Then, we can use lab private
pakages as if they are registered ones. (Usually, DEPOT_PATH = /home/username/.julia)


# WIP
Still need to add most of our lab packages to this registry.
